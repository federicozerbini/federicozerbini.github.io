*Title*: Single-valued periods in string theory
*Abstract*: Scattering amplitudes predict the probability of interaction of elementary particles. Without assuming any previous knowledge in string theory, we will review the state of the art in the study of (perturbative) string theory scattering amplitudes, which can be expressed in terms of interesting numbers and special functions. We will focus on the relations between amplitudes for open strings (related to gauge theories) and closed strings (related to gravity), and on how such relations are proven or conjectured to originate from the theory of single-valued periods, recently developed by Francis Brown.
