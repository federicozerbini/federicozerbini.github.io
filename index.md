Since December 2023, I have a Beatriz Galindo tenure track position at the mathematical department of the UNED University (Madrid, Spain).

I am mainly interested in:

* Periods and special functions arising from Riemann surfaces, such as multiple zeta values, multiple polylogarithms and higher-genus generalisations.

* All kinds of modular forms.

* Applications of the above objects to the computation of Feynman amplitudes, especially in superstring theory.

I am currently also interested in various topics at the interface between mathematics and physics, such as mirror symmetry, topological recursion and resurgence.

Together with [Francis Brown](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/francis.brown), [Erik Panzer](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/panzer/) and [Pierre Vanhove](https://sites.google.com/site/vanhovepierre/pierre-vanhove--en), I organise an [online seminar](https://www.ihes.fr/\~vanhove/motivefeynman-2023.html) on motives and period integrals in quantum field theory and string theory.

You can reach out to me at: f.zerbini "at" mat.uned.es

I will be on paternity leave until May 2025
