From September 2022 to November 2023 I was a postdoctoral fellow at the mathematical institute of the University of Oxford, and a lecturer at St. Peter's College.

Previously, I was funded by a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship for the project [HIPSAM](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/843960) (Higher Polylogarithms and String Amplitudes).

[Here](/uploads/Zerbini-CV.pdf) you can view my full CV.

[Here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07989) you can find my PhD Thesis, entitled "Elliptic multiple zeta values, modular graph functions and genus 1 superstring scattering amplitudes", published by the University of Bonn and supervised by [Don Zagier](https://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/zagier/).
