I am mainly interested in:

* Periods, and especially multiple zeta values, multiple polylogarithms and higher-genus generalisations

* Feynman amplitudes, and especially string theory amplitudes

* Modular forms

[Here](/uploads/Zerbini-CV.pdf) you can look at my CV.

[Here](http://hss.ulb.uni-bonn.de/2018/5000/5000.htm) you can find my PhD Thesis, entitled "Elliptic multiple zeta values, modular graph functions and genus 1 superstring scattering amplitudes", published by the University of Bonn and supervised by [Don Zagier](https://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/zagier/).
